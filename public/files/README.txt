Core Idea: A Qbank platform for QCM (multiple-choice) exams (CIA, CISA, CFA, CRISC, etc.).

Features:

Format: Questions, 4 options, explanation, immediate feedback.

The UI should builds momentum to ensure the user will continue using the app and returning afterwards

Wrong answers repeat later to ensure comprehension.

Options shuffle each time to prevent position memorization.

End Goal: Smart, efficient prep with monthly subscriptions
